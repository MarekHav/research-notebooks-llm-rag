## LLM & RAG Research Notebooks
This repository contains exploratory Jupyter notebooks created during my work as a research assistant.
The notebooks document experiments, intermediate analyses, and testing of different ideas related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## About this repository
These notebooks are not meant to be polished final projects.
They represent my thought process, experimentation, and iterative exploration of different approaches, models, and techniques.

The main goal of this repository is to:
document my experimental workflow,
showcase how I approach research problems,
and provide transparency into how ideas evolve over time.

## Contents
LLMPredictions.ipynb – experiments with LLM-based predictions and feature usage
anvil_LLM_RAG.ipynb – experiments related to RAG-based pipelines and application logic

## Disclaimer
This repository focuses on exploration rather than production-ready code.
Some notebooks may contain unfinished ideas, partial implementations, or alternative approaches.
